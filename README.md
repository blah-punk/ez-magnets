# Resizable Magnet Link Banner Userscript

## Description
This userscript creates a resizable banner at the top of a web page to display all magnet links found on the page in an easy-to-click format, bypassing annoying redirects and URL masking. The banner is scrollable and resizable, with the option to drag and adjust its height. The text of each link is derived from the `dn=` parameter in the magnet link.

## Features

- Banner is resizable via a draggable handle at the bottom.
